# Sentiment-Analysis-on-Danish-Social-Media
This repo contains annotated data to do sentiment analysis with supervised learning in the danish language. The dataset was created specifically to classify sentences to the root comments of political articles on social media.

The dataset consists of fine-grained polarity in the range from -2 to 2 - negative to postive. The quality of the fine-grained is note cross-validated and is therefore subject to uncertainties; however, the polarity has been cross-validated.
